Note that to disable the code fence option, the value portion of the
property needs to be left **empty** instead of setting to `nil`!

Here are few variables that you might like to change in the `local.mk`:

`prefix`
: Org installation directory

    {{< highlight makefile>}}
    prefix = /dir/where/you/want/to/install/org # Default: /usr/share
    {{< /highlight >}}

    The `.el` files will go to `$(prefix)/emacs/site-lisp/org` by
                default. If you'd like to change that, you can tweak the
                `lispdir` variable.

`infodir`
: Org Info installation directory. I like to keep the
    Info file for development version of Org in a separate
    directory.

    {{< highlight makefile>}}
    infodir = $(prefix)/org/info # Default: $(prefix)/info
    {{< /highlight >}}

`ORG_MAKE_DOC`
: Types of Org documentation you'd like to build by
    default.

    {{< highlight makefile>}}
    # Define below you only need info documentation, the default includes html and pdf
    ORG_MAKE_DOC = info pdf card # html
    {{< /highlight >}}

`ORG_ADD_CONTRIB`
: Packages from the `contrib/` directory that
    you'd like to build along with Org. Below are the ones on my
    _must-have_ list.

    {{< highlight makefile>}}
    # Define if you want to include some (or all) files from contrib/lisp
    # just the filename please (no path prefix, no .el suffix), maybe with globbing
    #   org-eldoc - Headline breadcrumb trail in minibuffer
    #   ox-extra - Allow ignoring just the heading, but still export the body of those headings
    #   org-mime - Convert org buffer to htmlized format for email
    ORG_ADD_CONTRIB = org-eldoc ox-extra org-mime
    {{< /highlight >}}

Here's an example of an `emacs-lisp` block:

{{< highlight emacs-lisp>}}
(defvar emacs-version-short (format "%s_%s"
                                    emacs-major-version emacs-minor-version)
  "A variable to store the current emacs versions as <MAJORVER>_<MINORVER>.
So, for emacs version 25.0.50.1, this variable will be 25_0.")
{{< /highlight >}}
