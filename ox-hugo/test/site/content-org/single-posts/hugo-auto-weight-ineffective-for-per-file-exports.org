#+TITLE: Hugo auto weight ineffective for per-file exports
#+AUTHOR:

#+HUGO_BASE_DIR: ../../
#+HUGO_WEIGHT: auto
#+HUGO_TAGS: weight

Even though we have =#+HUGO_WEIGHT: auto= in this file, the weight
will be treated as nil as this file is exported using the /per-file/
or /complete-file/ export flow.

The auto-weight calculation works *only* for /per-subtree/ flow.
