Here are few variables that you might like to change in the =local.mk=:
- =prefix= :: Org installation directory
 #+BEGIN_SRC makefile
prefix = /dir/where/you/want/to/install/org # Default: /usr/share
#+END_SRC
 The =.el= files will go to =$(prefix)/emacs/site-lisp/org= by
              default. If you'd like to change that, you can tweak the
              =lispdir= variable.
- =infodir= :: Org Info installation directory. I like to keep the
                   Info file for development version of Org in a separate
                   directory.
 #+BEGIN_SRC makefile
infodir = $(prefix)/org/info # Default: $(prefix)/info
#+END_SRC
- =ORG_MAKE_DOC= :: Types of Org documentation you'd like to build by
                    default.
 #+BEGIN_SRC makefile
# Define below you only need info documentation, the default includes html and pdf
ORG_MAKE_DOC = info pdf card # html
#+END_SRC
- =ORG_ADD_CONTRIB= :: Packages from the =contrib/= directory that
     you'd like to build along with Org. Below are the ones on my
     /must-have/ list.
 #+BEGIN_SRC makefile
# Define if you want to include some (or all) files from contrib/lisp
# just the filename please (no path prefix, no .el suffix), maybe with globbing
#   org-eldoc - Headline breadcrumb trail in minibuffer
#   ox-extra - Allow ignoring just the heading, but still export the body of those headings
#   org-mime - Convert org buffer to htmlized format for email
ORG_ADD_CONTRIB = org-eldoc ox-extra org-mime
#+END_SRC
